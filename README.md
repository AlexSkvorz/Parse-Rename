### **The first is the parsing of JSON files**

To work correctly, we need to enter the column names, which should be equal to the name and all attributes. After that, add the name of the folder and select the path where our JSON lies. An example (on 10 JSON) can be seen in the screenshots.

The program processes all JSON files located in this folder. In case of correct operation, an EXCEL file with the name you entered will appear on the desktop. Otherwise, the program will tell you what might be wrong.

Attention! 
JSON files must have the same structure to work correctly.
